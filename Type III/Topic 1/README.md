# Databases (SQL)

## What is this? 
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

## Where is this used?
Databases are used just about everywhere including banks, retail, websites and warehouses. Banks use databases to keep track of customer accounts, balances and deposits. Retail stores can use databases to store prices, customer information, sales information and quantity on hand.
