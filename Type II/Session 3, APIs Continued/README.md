# APIs contintued - Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will create an application showcasing the cosmos itself.
We will create a picture gallery using data from NASA's API.

#### Important Keywords:
API, requests, get, HTTP, python


## Instructions:

1. Generate a key for using the api.
   - Use the link to get to the nasa API website: https://api.nasa.gov/
   - Generate an api key as per instructions on the webpage.

2. Read the api description for Mars Rovers. (At bottom of page.)
   - Use the information you gathered to get 3 pictures from different cameras of each rover: Curiosity, Spirit, and Opportunity.
   - You can set other parameters, such as dates/locations/which cameras to your liking.

3. Create a webpage containing a picture gallery for the pictures you have gotten. (Example of a generic picture gallery in image below.)

## Bonus:

Implement any (or all) of the following features: (With no specific order)

* Choose one of the following: (Try and guess why you cannot do both things together.)
  - Change the way you get the images, such that the request to the image is done by client side code and not by server side code.
  - Implement caching, which means you save a copy of an image on your server to reduce the amount of requests to NASA.
* Create a new page showing the astronomy picture of the day.
* Create a new webpage which allows a user to pick a date, a rover, and a camera, and to view an image based on the parameters he chose.
  - Consider designing the webpage such that picking the parameters is interactive and interesting.
* Allow users to click on pictures in the gallery in order to spotlight them (Meaning the image will be centered, large, and the only image shown after clicking).
  - Also allow users to click the photo again to go back to gallery view.

#### Important keywords (for bonus):
ajax, caching, JS, CSS
